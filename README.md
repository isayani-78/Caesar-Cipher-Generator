# Caesar Cipher - Python Implementation

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description
This is a simple Python implementation of the **Caesar Cipher** encryption technique.
It works by shifting each character in the message by a fixed number of positions in a defined character set.

## âš¡ Features
- Supports **letters (uppercase & lowercase)**
- Supports **numbers and punctuation**
- User can set a **custom shift key**
- Encrypts and decrypts messages

## ðŸ”‘ How It Works
1. User enters a message and a shift key.
2. The program shifts each character in the message forward by the key value to encrypt.
3. To decrypt, it shifts the characters back by the same key value.

## â–¶ How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate into the project folder
      (cd caesar-cipher-generator)
3. Run the program using Python
      (python caesar_cipher.py)

(If you are on Linux/Mac and python runs Python 2, use python3 instead.)
## Follow the prompts
i) Enter the message you want to encrypt.
ii) Enter a key (shift value).
iii) The program will display the encrypted message and then decrypt it back.

## ðŸ–¥ Example
```bash
Enter message: Hello123!
Enter key (shift value): 3
Encrypted: Khoor456$
Decrypted: Hello123!
