# Caesar Cipher - Python Implementation

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description
This is a simple Python implementation of the **Caesar Cipher** encryption technique.
It works by shifting each character in the message by a fixed number of positions in a defined character set.

## âš¡ Features
- Supports **letters (uppercase & lowercase)**
- Supports **numbers and punctuation**
- User can set a **custom shift key**
- Encrypts and decrypts messages

## ðŸ”‘ How It Works
1. User enters a message and a shift key.
2. The program shifts each character in the message forward by the key value to encrypt.
3. To decrypt, it shifts the characters back by the same key value.

## ðŸ–¥ Example
```bash
Enter message: Hello123!
Enter key (shift value): 3
Encrypted: Khoor456$
Decrypted: Hello123!
